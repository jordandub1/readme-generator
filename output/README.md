  ## Description
  I created the README Generator to quickly construct a professional README file for any new project. By utilizing the Inquirer package, I was able to create a series of prompts to collect the necessary user input to write a professional and detailed README file consisting of the following sections: Title of Project, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. 

  ## Table of Contents

  * [Description](#description)
  * [Installation](#installation)
